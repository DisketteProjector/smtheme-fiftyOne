Introduction
-----------
Lambda (formerly FiftyOne) is a project to create a new, prospective default theme for StepMania 5.1.

The current default theme dates back to the original sm-ssc fork, and barring design tweaks over the years, has remained relatively unchanged. As 5.1 has some of the most significant changes to StepMania in quite a long time, it is only appropriate that a new default theme be constructed to showcase its advancements.

Among the technical goals for Lambda are to provide the same level of functionality as the current default theme, as well as familiarities, whilst futureproofing it for future changes by reducing its reliance on legacy components. Lambda is also meant to reflect modern design trends, utilizing a clean and gradient-based aesthetic with a friendlier and more inviting look. The theme is also meant to have a more vivid and less duochromatic appearance than the previous default. To provide more efficient use of space on larger displays, Lambda uses a base resolution of 720p as opposed to 480p. Yes, this may break some stuff, but it's not like SM 5.1 has already broken stuff for the sake of progress to begin with.

Progress
-----------
Lambda is still a major WIP, and it has only scratched the surface. Feel free to contribute and make pull requests. 

Source code
-----------
Inkscape SVG source code is available for the majority of graphics created in the _src folder. Some of the original mockups are also included for reference, although they are meant primarily for reference purposes due to changes in the theme's style since these mockups (such as the removal of rounded corners and increased use of chamfered edges and diamond motifs).

The main fonts are the current version of Roboto and Noto Sans <https://www.google.com/design/spec/resources/roboto-noto-fonts.html>, and Open Sans (although, preferably, Noto Sans should eventually be used in any location Open Sans is currently used). Certain accents make use of the font Overpass. <http://overpassfont.org/>
